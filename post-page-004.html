                            <p>I am writing this blog to expose our father's love with an illustration in a simplified way so that everyone can see his love and be free from fear. By receiving his perfect love, it will reveal to us who we truly are in Jesus, which will give us the authority and power to walk this life.

                                With love comes power and authority, as stated in 2 Timothy 1:7, "for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control" and in 1 John 4:18, "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love."
                                
                                This illustration will show the comparison of how a man deals with his children towards judgment and punishment and how God deals with us towards judgment and punishment. We can see the similarities and differences between man's way and God's way.
                                
                                I strongly believe that God gave us relationships in this physical life, such as father and son, husband and wife, friends, and family, so that we can relate to his actions towards us and see his unconditional love behind it.
                                
                               <p> Let's begin to expose...
                                
                                An earthly father instructs his child not to touch the fire (LAW). The father gives this instruction (law) to protect his child from harm because he loves his child. Love is the reason for the law, and the law has two purposes: to display the father's love to his son so that his son will know how much his father loves him and to protect his son from any harm. Similarly, our Heavenly Father gave us the law to protect us out of love (Old Testament through Moses and the prophets).
                                
                                An earthly father also tells his son about the outcome of touching the flame. He educates his son with the knowledge of judgment and punishment that if his son breaks the law, he will experience pain and hurt, and it is bad. So the earthly father introduces judgment and punishment to his son so that he will obey his father's word (LAW). The father tells all this not to instill fear in his son but to protect him, which is the result of his love towards him.
                                
                                Heavenly Father tells us the outcome of hellfire and Judgment if we disobey the law. But he also tells us the way out of the punishment if we break the law. He makes himself the way to ensure that we are safe and loved.</p>
                                
                               <p>When an earthly father's child breaks the law and touches the flame, and gets hurt, the earthly father will run to his son and do everything to rescue him from pain and hurt. He will not stand and watch his son suffer as a result of disobeying his words. He will do everything in his power to make his son feel alright and happy. However, when we observe this closely, his son has already been judged and punished for breaking the law his father gave him. Even though his father's heart is to protect his son, he could not save him from the hurt. If the human father had the power to see the future or an option to take the pain instead of his son, he would definitely do it.</p>
                                <p>Even though his fatherâ€™s heart is to protect his son, he could not save him from the hurt. If the human father had the power to see the future, he would have saved his son, or if he had the option to take the pain instead in his son's place, he would definitely do so. All of this is a human perspective. When we look at God's perspective as a Father in Heaven, as God who knows the start and the end, as the God who never breaks rules and is unjust, let us see how he will handle this. When we break the law, we have to be punished; there is no change in that. If God changed that with his power to save his children from punishment, he could not be just. So, he volunteered himself in our place as his own son and took all the pain and hurt so that we will be saved from the punishment of breaking the law. In this way, he is not changing the future and misusing his power. He is still just by the act and also uses the opportunity to express his immense love by giving his own son in our place. He delivers everyone from punishment, so you cannot be punished unless you reject the help of the Father in Heaven.</p>
