                            <h5>A Definition Of Death</h5>
                            <p>
                                Death, as defined by logic and science, is the irreversible cessation of all vital
                                functions, particularly marked by the permanent stoppage of the heart, respiration, and
                                brain activity. However, the concept of death discussed in Genesis 2:17 seems to extend
                                beyond physical mortality. When God warns against eating from the tree of the knowledge
                                of good and evil, stating, "for when you eat from it, you will certainly die," it raises
                                questions about the nature of this death. 
                                While the initial interpretation might suggest physical death, further examination
                                reveals nuances. God mentions "On That Day" you will surely die, yet Adam continues to
                                live physically for many years afterward. This challenges the assumption of Adam's
                                inherent immortality before the fall. The mention of the Tree of Life introduces the
                                possibility of physical immortality, a choice Adam could have made to eat from it and
                                live forever in the physical realm. 
                                Some argue that these elements are metaphorical, but adhering to God's description of a
                                tangible tree and fruit can provide clarity. The mention of the Tree of Life suggests
                                that physical immortality was an option for Adam, and God presented him with a choice. 
                                As for what God defines as death, various interpretations exist. Some suggest the death
                                of the spirit, but considering the immortality and indestructibility of the spirit as
                                God's essence in humans, this seems implausible. The spirit, being akin to God's DNA
                                within us, remains immortal and indestructible, even in the face of hell, as indicated
                                in Revelation. 
                                In Matthew 10:28, the distinction between body and soul is made, emphasizing that the
                                soul cannot be killed by those who harm the body. However, it does not mention the
                                destruction of the spirit, reinforcing the belief in its enduring nature. 
                                Therefore, the concept of death in the biblical context extends beyond mere physicality,
                                encompassing the potential for eternal separation from God or a choice for physical
                                immortality through the Tree of Life. The immortality of the spirit remains a consistent
                                theme throughout scripture, emphasizing its indestructible nature. 
                            </p>

                           <h5>Another Perspective </h5>

                            <p> Some suggest that, for God, a day is equivalent to 1000 years, and vice versa. While I
                                agree with this perspective, an issue arises when examining the book of Genesis. After
                                creating time, God establishes the definition of a day in Genesis 1:5, where He calls
                                light "day" and darkness "night," with the occurrence of evening and morning marking the
                                first day. 
                                The question then arises: Did God lie when He said, "you will die on the same day"
                                regarding the forbidden fruit? Certainly not; the challenge lies in our limited human
                                perspective, which typically associates death solely with physical mortality. This
                                perspective is rooted in our tendency to believe only what we can see, shaped by
                                countless funerals and our brain's comprehension of physical death. 
                                To understand what God meant by Adam dying on the same day, we must examine the events
                                following the consumption of the forbidden fruit in Genesis 3:8-9. Their eyes were
                                opened, revealing their nakedness, and they hid from the Lord. While this might suggest
                                a sudden realization, it's crucial to delve into the meaning of the key word
                                "realized." 
                                "Realized" signifies becoming fully aware of something as a fact, understanding it
                                clearly. This implies that, before this moment, Adam and Eve lacked clear awareness or
                                knowledge of their nakedness. The knowledge of good and evil brought a shift in their
                                consciousness, removing childlike innocence and introducing self-awareness. 
                                Connecting the dots, the fruit bestowed the knowledge of good and evil, prompting the
                                awareness of nakedness and the birth of "SELF" in humans for the first time. Adam,
                                initially created as a fully grown adult with childlike innocence, experienced a
                                transformation, introducing selfishness and the inherent flaw of human nature. 
                                Adam's pre-fall state, marked by spiritual perception and a hybrid life, contrasts
                                sharply with the post-fall reality. In a moment, the blanket of ignorance and
                                selflessness was pulled away, revealing a new operating mode where his eyes were guided
                                by the knowledge of good and evil. However, this still does not provide a clear answer
                                to the notion of dying on the same day.</p>
                                <h5>Another Perspective </h5>
                            <p> Some assert that Adam's death after the fall was losing access to the spiritual realm,
                                but this is not accurate. Even post-fall, he maintained access to the spiritual realm,
                                evident in his ability to see God again, given that God is Spirit (John 4:24). His
                                capabilities remained intact, yet a significant shift occurred in his operating system,
                                now influenced by the knowledge of good and evil, introducing the concept of operating
                                from SELF, which was absent before the fall. 
                                To delve into the essence of death, we look at Adam's initial response—covering himself
                                with fig leaves. This action suggests self-reliance, a belief that he could fix
                                everything independently, without needing God's assistance. This inclination resonates
                                with the human tendency to approach God through personal efforts, a theme echoed
                                throughout the Old Testament. However, the recurring message is that human actions alone
                                cannot rectify our state, as we remain disconnected from our life source. Our fallen
                                minds often hinder us from acknowledging our need for divine help, leading to the
                                adoption of flawed traditions and rituals, leaving us in a state of profound despair
                                with various manifestations of death. <br>
                                As for the efficacy of fig leaves as a solution, that remains a topic for another day.
                                The subsequent significant action Adam took is directly tied to the concept of death—he
                                hid from God. In other words, he chose to distance himself from God, driven by the
                                guilt, shame, and fear instilled by the knowledge of good and evil. This fear prevented
                                him from approaching God, and while his previous actions did not lead to death, this
                                decision to separate himself from God resulted in death. As mentioned earlier, God
                                presented Adam with choices, and now he chose to stay away from God due to fear and
                                guilt.<br>
                                According to God, death is the result of anything separating itself from its life
                                source. For instance, water serves as the life source for all fishes, and the
                                consequence of separating a fish from water manifests as its physical death. Similarly,
                                the death discussed by God is an act of separation itself. 
                                When Adam chose to separate himself from God in his mind, he experienced death. The
                                manifestation of death is merely a consequence of this separation from the life source. 
                                Another way to comprehend this concept is by examining the creation records in Genesis.
                                God spoke to the source to bring forth life, directing the Earth to generate various
                                land animals and speaking to the waters to bring forth creatures that inhabit them.
                                Logically, God speaks to the source to bring life dependent on it. Thus, separating a
                                fish from its source (water) results in death, just as placing land animals in water
                                would lead to death. <br>
                                Now, observe closely whom God spoke to when creating humans: "Let us make human beings
                                in our image." He spoke to Himself, using the phrase "Let us make," indicating a triune
                                God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This trinity is evident from the very beginning: 
                                "In the beginning God" - God the Father, "The Spirit of God was hovering" - Holy Spirit,
                                "And God said, 'Let there be light'" - Word of God (Jesus). 
                                Adam, by choosing to separate himself from his life source (the triune God), experienced
                                death on the same day. The manifestation of death in the physical realm occurred as a
                                consequence unfolding in time.<br>

                                In my understanding of God our Father, if Adam had chosen to run to God and expressed
                                remorse for disobedience instead of hiding, it could have altered the course of history.
                                If God can forgive the entire mankind now, wouldn't He have forgiven Adam, His first
                                human child, then? Certainly, He would have. However, God's plan surpasses our
                                comprehension, though it is simple enough for us to grasp through the grace and wisdom
                                He provides. 
                                Every aspect has its own nature, and the nature of the knowledge of good and evil
                                manifested fear, guilt, shame, eventually leading Adam to choose separation from God,
                                resulting in death. While we often associate death solely with physical demise, it
                                extends beyond that—physical death is the last visible manifestation stage of its
                                course. 
                                Anything lost when disconnected from one's life source is considered death, including
                                lack, sickness, a corrupted mind, selfishness, stress, pride, shame, fear, and more. I
                                rest my case here, hoping we've glimpsed the truth about death from God's perspective. 
                                The good news is that we are no longer separated from our Father; we are reconciled with
                                God through Jesus. When the Bible mentions repentance, it literally means changing the
                                direction you're going, urging you to stop running away from your Father and turn back
                                to Him as your life source. Until we reconnect with Him, whatever success, or wealth we
                                amass in the physical realm renders us akin to a fish out of water. <br>
                                Even wealthy and successful individuals seek peace, sometimes opting for destructive
                                avenues like drugs, religion, rituals, or suicide. The reason God took thousands of
                                years to send Jesus and recorded so much history in the Bible or Torah is
                                straightforward. After the Fall, God could only approach us through the knowledge of
                                good and evil, necessitating real-time events as humans became beings who only believe
                                what they see. It took thousands of years for humans to reach a point where they needed
                                God, realizing that life without God is miserable, given the fallen belief that one can
                                fix everything independently. 
                                The delivery of information in text and stories is intentional, mirroring how humans
                                accumulate knowledge. God provides us with a book to learn and accumulate the right
                                knowledge, coupled with the Holy Spirit as a gift, offering wisdom and revelation to
                                understand the singular truth—getting back to our Father is the only solution needed for
                                all our problems.  </p>

                            <h5>Why Jesus</h5>
                            <p>There exists a profound reason why Jesus holds immense importance in the Bible. For
                                centuries, one of the most entrenched beliefs has been our unworthiness to be in God's
                                presence, considering ourselves too tainted. To break free from this stronghold, Jesus
                                becomes indispensable. Without Jesus, and with our knowledge of good and evil alone,
                                returning to our Father is deemed impossible. It is no wonder God emphasizes in John
                                14:6: 
                                "Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father
                                except through me.'" 
                                The simplicity of this statement underscores the profound impact of the knowledge of
                                good and evil on Adam. It led him to believe that God was angry and poised for
                                punishment—a misconception that still plagues humanity. Today, as individuals influenced
                                by the same knowledge, it is crucial to be unequivocally convinced that God loves us
                                more than Himself. Through Jesus, we gain a deeper understanding of God's love, enabling
                                us to approach Him with the endearing terms of "Abba father" or "daddy." 
                                Jesus consistently advocated God as Father during his preaching, challenging the fearful
                                beliefs ingrained in people—that God is holy, and we, as sinners, cannot enter His
                                presence. Unfortunately, even today, many religious institutions operate from this
                                limiting belief. 
                                The significance of the veil being split at Jesus's death is symbolic. It signals that
                                nothing hinders us from running to sit on our Father's lap. Jesus is the door, the way,
                                and the truth. God desires our complete conviction, even stating the need to be "born
                                again." This rebirth is not a physical or ritualistic transformation but an act of faith
                                and belief, instilled through knowledge. It convinces our soul that we are new beings,
                                empowering us to approach God. 
                                Our Father exhausts all avenues to reassure us that we are perfectly able to return to
                                Him. Every concern that holds us back has been addressed, providing the assurance we
                                need to approach Him with confidence. 
                                 
                                Returning to God is a simple process—understand Jesus to comprehend how much God loves
                                you, follow His ways, and walk by faith, not by sight. By doing so, you will witness the
                                tables turning, and one day, you will find yourself on your father's lap. It's as simple
                                as that. 
                                All you need to do now is believe that you are completely forgiven. There is no need to
                                run away and hide; He is your own Dad, and He already resolved all issues when He
                                declared, "IT IS FINISHED." Reconcile back to your life source and re-establish the
                                relationship with your father. Stop believing that you are a sinner; God has already
                                dealt with it. Run back to Him NOW.  </p>

                                <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                            <p> Before I conclude, consider that God himself possesses the knowledge of good and evil.
                                There's nothing inherently wrong with having that type of knowledge, but God's way
                                involves operating from an other-centered perspective. As a Father, His desire is for
                                His children to emulate Him and do better things. While we received the knowledge of
                                good and evil through Adam and operated from a self-centered approach, through Jesus, we
                                learn to shift to an other-centered perspective. This shift is significant. 
                                This is why scripture talks about renewing the mind is vital and it must be diligent. 
                                Some people even angry on Adam as he ate the forbidden fruit,  
                                No, do not harbor resentment towards Adam; it is all part of the great plan. Embrace the
                                knowledge of good and evil as a fruit that facilitates this transformative shift. 
                                 
                                For the sake of conversation, I often wonder about God creating Adam as a fully grown
                                man. How did Adam relate to God without the organic growth process that babies like us
                                experience? We, through time and events, organically build relationships and come to
                                understand the love of our parents. Did Adam have a similar dynamic with God, or is the
                                missing piece a deliberate aspect of God's plan, where the knowledge of good and evil
                                becomes vital? This, in turn, raises the question if it's all part of God's overarching
                                plan, because sometimes I ponder why He placed that tree in the middle of the
                                garden—perhaps to ensure it was a daily reminder. 
                                Additionally, why was the Lamb slain before creation? Could the great fall be within the
                                divine plan? God's statement, "I know the end from the beginning," prompts further
                                reflection. Does religion sometimes misrepresent this, suggesting God was surprised by
                                Adam eating the fruit and that we are all doomed? 
                                These questions regularly traverse my neural pathways, yet one certainty remains—I know
                                God is a good and loving Father, and nothing detrimental originates from Him. Let's
                                rejoice in this understanding. 
                                I hope the broader perspective has been revealed to you, shedding light on how great and
                                awesome our Father God truly is.
                            </p>
