                         <p>If you ask a Christian how our sins are forgiven through Jesus, the answer would be 'By his blood, shed on the cross as a sacrifice on behalf of humanity.' But I will say that someone got forgiven for their sins even before Christ actually died on the cross. I did not say this, but Jesus did.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">Matthew 9<br>
                            Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town. Some people brought to him a man who was paralyzed and was lying on a mat. Jesus saw that these people had much faith. So he said to the paralyzed man, “Young man, you will be glad to hear this.
                            Your SINS ARE FORGIVEN "</blockquote>
                        <p>A lot of people have questions such as, "How is it possible for sins to be forgiven before Jesus died?" "How can sins be forgiven if the sacrifice has not been made and the blood has not been shed?" In response to these thoughts, Jesus spoke in Matthew 7.

                            In this passage, some of the teachers of the law were offended by what Jesus said about forgiving sins. Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked why they were thinking such evil thoughts. He explained that the Son of Man has the power on earth to forgive sins, but he wanted to prove this to them. He asked, "What if I say to the man, ‘Stand up and walk’? Then you will be able to see that I really have this power." He then commanded the paralyzed man to stand up, take his mat, and go home. The man obeyed and the people were amazed, praising God for letting someone have such power.
                            
                            So, Jesus had the power to forgive sins even before he died on the cross. He demonstrated this power by healing the paralyzed man, which showed that he had the authority to forgive sins.</p> 
                        
                    

                        

                        <p>Now, people may say that man's sins were forgiven because Jesus said it. He is God Himself in flesh. But my point is, Jesus only said it and had not yet done it on the cross. So why do you not see this act of God as "unjust" since He is the one who said that sacrifice has to be made and blood has to be shed to forgive sins? If that's the case, how can Jesus forgive sins before the bloodshed has been done? Isn't this contradicting what He said about the way to forgive sins?

                            At this point, you might say, "It's God."
                            
                            "God is powerful to do all things, and there is nothing impossible for Him."
                            
                            On the same note, if someone believes that God will provide a way for everyone to enter His kingdom because He is all-powerful and nothing is impossible for Him, then you might say, "How can that be possible? If that is so, then that would make God 'unjust'."
                            
                            Which glorifies God more?
                            
                            Believing that God will save everyone or believing that God made some of His children destined for hell?
                            
                            Believing that God is capable of saving all or believing that God is incapable of saving all?
                            
                            Above all, God instructed us to love everyone, not judge. So our role is to believe all good things and love others but not to judge.</p>

                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">John 3:17 <br>
                                God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him. <br>
                                 1 Timothy 2 <br>
                                This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth </blockquote>

                        <p>According to the scriptures above, God has the authority to do what He wills, and His will is clearly to save all His children, and that is the reason Jesus died for "ALL."
                            God does not have to bend any rules or do anything unjust to make it happen. We often think with a legal mind when it comes to others, but God's wisdom is above all our minds. Like Jesus fulfilled the law not by keeping the law but by loving others. The purpose of the law is to make everyone love everyone.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> Matthew 7:12<br> 
                            “Do for others what you would want them to do for you. This is the meaning of the Law of Moses and the teaching of the prophets".<br>
                            Galatians 5:14 <br>
                            "For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself."</p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>We believed after witnessing the bloodshed on the cross. Our way is to first see and then believe. It's the way of fallen man - seeing and believing.

                            God's way is to first believe, and then we will see. As we all know, God made everything out of nothing, so it makes sense that He believes first, and manifestation follows next.
                            
                            What is inside will manifest outside, and that is the law of manifestation, but we are only sure after the action has taken place.
                            
                            According to scripture, the bloodshed of Jesus happened way before the world existed. Yes, the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world.</p>

                        <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> Revelations 13:8<br>
                            All who dwell on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
                            </blockquote>
                      <p>Lot of us think Grace came after the law,
                        But the truth is 
                        Out of grace came Law.
                        Grace was there before the foundation of the world. 
                        In fact, out of grace, everything came into existence.</p>
                    <blockquote  class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">2 Timothy 1:9 <br>
                        He has saved us and called us to a holy life-not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace. This grace was given us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time.</blockquote>

                        <p>God’s way is more spiritual than natural because everything tangible has to be manifested from the intangible. So when we say God will make a way for everyone to enter His kingdom, we do not say it based on who we are and what we do, but on who God is and what He can do.

                            Whenever we judge someone regarding going to hell, why does that person always have to be someone else, rather than your own children? In the same way, we are God's children. The way we see our children is the way God sees us, in fact, even better than that.
                            
                            Whenever you get to the point of judging others about going to hell, or believing that God destined some people to go to hell, just ask yourself this question: If you are a parent of two children, would you be able to kill one and love the other? Or would you be able to plan destruction for one and blessings for the other? You cannot do such a thing because of love, but you say God can do such things and also say that God is love.</p>
                            
                           <h5> GOD IS LOVE. </h5>
                            
                            <p>It's like this: a father instructs his two sons to do a job, one obeys and the other does not. When the father writes a will for his inheritance, he will still equally split it because the relationship is built on the father's love, not on the obedience or actions of his children.
                            
                            If your son is a sinner and your neighbor's son is righteous, will you give all your wealth and inheritance to your neighbor's righteous son? No one will. You will still give your wealth to your own sinful son because the relationship cannot be built upon actions or obedience but on love. God gave us children to have a relationship with. God planned everything to show us that He loves us so much, and we are His children. If the plan destroys His children, then what is the use of the plan?<br>
                            <br>
                            THE THOUGHT OF EVERYONE BEING SAVED CAN COME ONLY OUT OF LOVE.<br>
                            
                            So I boldly proclaim that everyone will be in heaven based on who our Father is.
                            
                            "You are forgiven, so go, and sin no more."
