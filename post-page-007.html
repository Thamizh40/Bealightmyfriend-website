                            <h6>Why did God take so much time for everything?</h6>

                            <p>Why was there such a delay in sending Jesus, who is the only way to save humanity from
                                sin? Why not immediately after Adam sinned? To answer these questions, we need to
                                understand what time is and how we are related to time. According to Wikipedia, time is
                                the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently
                                irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future.</p>

                            <p>God created time first when it comes to the creation of this physical world. Genesis 1:1
                                states, "In the beginning," and this is where the dimension called "time" was born.
                                Everything created after that falls under that dimension, including God's works in this
                                world. It took six days (time) for God to create this beautiful universe.</p>

                            <p>The ultimate purpose of God creating us is to have a relationship as father and
                                son/daughter, and He created us for His own pleasure, just as we have children for our
                                own pleasure and to have a relationship with them. Our main purpose as children of God
                                (humans) is to receive and understand God's love so that we can be in a relationship
                                with Him and enjoy it as father and son/daughter.</p>

                            <p>However, does our child understand the parent's love from the moment they are born? I do
                                not think so. They will not know "what love is" in the first place as an infant, but
                                they will eventually understand when they grow up. All they need is time. By time and
                                through time, the child will grow and understand the love of their parents. But
                                remember, the parents' love is already there, and it will be unchanged forever towards
                                the child. In fact, out of love is where the child is born, but it takes time for the
                                child to grow and understand it.</p>

                            <p>Similarly, God made us out of love, and His love is unchanged towards us, but it takes
                                time for us to understand it. In this world, only through time can we learn, grow, and
                                do anything. Time consists of a chain of events that will reveal different stages of
                                truth to understand things.</p>

                            <p>So now we know that God needs time to show His love towards us because, as humans, we
                                need time to grow and understand His love. This is why it makes sense why it took so
                                long for Jesus to come in the flesh. We needed all the events that happened before Jesus
                                to learn and understand different stages of truth about God's love. This is the reason
                                why God recorded all the events and gave us a book, the Bible. Every action of God
                                towards humanity is out of love. We might not understand certain things, but we can be
                                certain that our Father does everything out of love.</p>

                            <p>When Jesus said, "It is finished," it literally means there are no more events God can do
                                to showcase His love towards us. Jesus is the highest expression of His grace and love.
                                Let us receive His love, my brothers and sisters, and enjoy the time we have.</p>
