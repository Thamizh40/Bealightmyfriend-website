                        <article>
                            <p>What is freedom? The power or right to act, speak, or think as one wants. Freedom means
                                being
                                free to choose, but every action or choice we make will have a consequence that might be
                                good or bad, depending on the nature of the choice made. The outcome of our choices
                                dictates
                                our future. If the outcome is good and favorable, then we will be happy and satisfied.
                                Otherwise, we may feel sadness and depression.True freedom means being free to choose,
                                which
                                gives positive consequences that uplift our life, rather than putting our life in
                                bondage.
                                In other words, true freedom is the one that brings pure happiness and peace. Having
                                freedom
                                alone does not mean we will be happy and satisfied, as we all have the freedom to choose
                                many things in life and may face bad consequences that put our life under bondage and
                                suffering. Let us see from the very beginning how this works and what the remedy is to
                                be
                                truly free with joy and peace. In the beginning, God created Adam and Eve. They had free
                                will, but did they have true freedom? They did not know of good and evil as God himself
                                confirmed it by saying: </p>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> Genesis 3: And the Lord God said, “The man
                                has
                                now become like one of us, knowing good and evil.”</blockquote>
                            <p> I assume they were in a state of bliss and ignorance. In today's world, we say
                                “Ignorance is
                                bliss”. Their awareness was only about God and his creations in existence. They were so
                                ignorant that they did not know of nakedness, even though they were naked. They had no
                                knowledge of freedom or goodness, as it requires knowing the other side of those things
                                to
                                understand the meaning. Till the fall of mankind, there was no actual necessity to know
                                the
                                evil side, as man was in a state of ignorance, like a child who didn't know what is good
                                and
                                bad, but the fall of mankind began from evil as death, which is a separation of God and
                                man.
                                For example,
                            <ul class="list-unstyled">
                                <li> Without darkness, there is no light.</li>
                                <li> Without evil, there is no goodness.</li>
                                <li> Without law, there is no grace.</li>
                                <li> Without sin, there is no forgiveness.</li>
                                <li> Without work, there is no rest.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p> No wonder the scripture says, Romans 8: And we know that all things work together for
                                good
                                to them that love God, to them who are they called according to his purpose. We need
                                understanding on all things (good and evil) that work together for good when it relates
                                to
                                people who choose God. This is how God designed it to fulfill his eternal plan. There is
                                no
                                hero without a villain, so Satan turned against God, and his ways are always against God
                                and
                                his ways. Satan is not a creator, but a manipulator. God wanted Adam to trust his words
                                and
                                obey him, but Satan made Adam distrust God and disobey. God introduced selflessness,
                                love,
                                and grace. Satan introduced selfishness, fear, and torment. Sin introduced death. Grace
                                introduced rebirth and resurrection. Sin separates. Grace unifies. Law made us
                                understand
                                that we are sinners, and sin gives life to judgment, which results in death. So God
                                introduced sacrifice as a way out of this eternal bondage. This is the main reason God
                                chased Adam out of the garden before he tried to eat from the tree of life and live an
                                eternal life under a curse. Sacrifice leads to a new start and made us understand we
                                need
                                help. We need a saviour.</p>

                            <p> In the above chain of events, how can we experience true freedom and happiness? What is
                                true
                                freedom? Is free will true freedom? I don’t think so, because it is the reason for the
                                fall
                                of humanity. Then what is free will? Free will is the power of choice, but choices come
                                with
                                consequences, both good and evil. Choices always come with “terms and conditions.” How
                                can
                                there be freedom with “terms and conditions,” because with choice, there is always
                                bondage?
                                God said, “You can eat any fruit except one,” there goes the condition. Then what is
                                true
                                freedom? True freedom is having the power of choice, and the choices should have only
                                good
                                consequences. This is impossible. How can we expect good to happen if we choose
                                something
                                bad? If things worked like that, it would destroy the true balance of life. How can we
                                ever
                                experience true freedom? Why did God make it this way? Yet we know nothing bad comes
                                from
                                God. And all things work together for good to those who love God. Hence, I conclude that
                                true freedom is life without choices. But how can that be possible? How can we live
                                without
                                making any choices? We make our life with a series of choices. True freedom is making
                                the
                                right choices all the time. Is this even possible for a fallen human mind? I don’t think
                                so,
                                because we already learned that we are sinners by the law. Then, how can we achieve
                                this?
                                Only God can make such choices. Yes, that is right, only God can. He cannot sin or make
                                bad
                                choices, which makes him God. But can God make choices for you and me? Yes, if we allow
                                him
                                to represent our lives. It's the same as placing someone or something in our place for
                                sacrifice to get free from judgment. Therefore, God offers himself as a sacrifice on the
                                cross on behalf of the entire humanity’s sin through his Son Jesus and gave us freedom
                                as a
                                gift. The way humanity fell down with that one choice of disobeying God, the same way,
                                we
                                make that one choice of complete surrender to God, allowing God to take our place to
                                deal
                                with everything. Now we need not worry about anything. We will be free from
                                consequences,
                                just as we are free from judgment.</p>

                            <p>True submission gives true freedom. Oneness with God gives true freedom. Submission to
                                God
                                results in replacing our consciousness with God. God becomes our consciousness. If God
                                himself becomes our awareness or consciousness, how can we make wrong choices? We are no
                                longer responsible for our future, just like the sheep that never have to worry about
                                anything, but the shepherds do. Sheep need to eat, sleep, and enjoy their existence
                                because
                                it is the shepherd's responsibility to take care of them. That's why scripture calls
                                God's
                                people his sheep. In reality, sheep will not survive without a shepherd. Therefore, the
                                scripture says:</p>

                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> Psalm 23: The Lord is my Shepherd; I have
                                all
                                that I need. He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside quiet waters; he
                                refreshes my soul; he guides me along the right path.</p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> John 10: I am the good shepherd; I know my
                                sheep and they know me. </blockquote>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">Psalm 37: Take delight in the LORD, and he
                                will
                                give you the desires of your heart.</blockquote>

                            <p> The constant thoughts or desires in our consciousness will manifest in our lives. If you
                                don’t believe it, look back at your life. You will find evidence that all the things you
                                have are a by- product of your thoughts and desires first. The Old Testament scripture
                                in
                                Joshua 1 states that we should keep the Book of the Law on our lips, meditate on it day
                                and
                                night, and be careful to do everything written in it. This leads to prosperity and
                                success
                                under the Law. However, after Christ took our place as a sacrifice to defeat death and
                                judgment, things changed. It is now better than before. Instead of God being outside of
                                us
                                and his words being inside through the Law, He now lives inside us and becomes one with
                                us
                                through grace. We now believe in one thing from which all other things come from, and we
                                make one choice of choosing Jesus as our sacrifice, which gives us one consequence of
                                God
                                being one with us. Through faith and belief in Christ, God lives in us. We become one
                                with
                                Him through Jesus.
                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">Galatians 2 states, I am crucified with
                                Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but He
                                who lives in me."

                            <p>This is God becoming our consciousness through Jesus. Jesus is mentioned as a door in
                                Scripture, a door that helps us go to heaven and brings heaven down to earth. John 10
                                states,</p>
                            <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he
                                will
                                be saved." <br>
                                Matt 18 also states, "Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in
                                heaven,
                                and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."</blockquote>

                            <blockquote>
                                <p>True freedom comes by making a choice to submit to God. He becomes our consciousness
                                    and
                                    gives us desires. He will make our choices, and we can be free from everything.</p>
