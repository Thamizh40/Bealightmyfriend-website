<p>What is freedom? At its essence, freedom is the power or right to act, speak, or think as we wish. It’s the ability to make decisions independently. However, freedom is not without responsibility. Every choice we make brings consequences—some good, some bad. The outcomes of these choices shape our future, leading to happiness and peace or, conversely, sadness and regret. </p>
                            
                            <p>True freedom is not simply about having the power to choose; it’s about making choices that lead to positive outcomes, bringing peace and fulfillment. But freedom alone does not guarantee happiness. The choices we make can sometimes bring suffering or put us in a state of bondage.
<p>To understand true freedom, let’s go back to the beginning, to the story of Adam and Eve. God gave them free will, but they didn’t have the knowledge of good and evil. They were initially in a state of blissful ignorance, unaware of the consequences of their actions. God had created them in His image, and their awareness was only of Him and His creations. In their innocence, they didn’t even know they were naked.</p>

                            <p> They lacked the understanding of good and evil, as it was unnecessary for them until the fall of mankind. The fall began when they chose to disobey God. It was from this choice that sin entered the world, introducing separation from God, and ultimately, death. This story shows us that true freedom cannot exist without an understanding of both good and evil.  </p>
                            <p> Without darkness, we wouldn’t know light. Without evil, there would be no goodness. Without law, there is no grace. Without sin, there is no forgiveness. In this balance, we see how God designed the world: good and evil working together for His eternal plan. Romans 8 reminds us that, "all things work together for good to those who love God" (Romans 8:28), emphasizing that even in the midst of trials, God is at work.</p>
                            <p> Freedom, however, is not just about making choices; it's about making the right choices. But how can we always make the right choice? The answer lies in the nature of free will. Free will gives us the ability to choose, but every choice comes with consequences. For example, God told Adam, “You may eat from any tree in the garden except one” (Genesis 2:16-17), signaling that true freedom includes responsibility and limits. If freedom only meant choosing whatever we want without consequences, it would result in chaos.</p>
                            <p> The truth is that true freedom is the ability to choose the right thing, but this is impossible on our own. As fallen beings, we are prone to making wrong choices. The law reveals our shortcomings, showing us that we cannot achieve true freedom through our own efforts. So, how can we experience this true freedom?</p>
                            <p> The answer is found in God. God, who is incapable of sin, offers Himself as the ultimate solution. Jesus became the sacrifice for humanity’s sin, offering freedom from judgment and consequences. Through Jesus, we receive the gift of freedom from the consequences of our wrong choices.</p>
                            <p> When we surrender ourselves to God, we experience true freedom. Our worries are no longer ours to bear because we trust that God is in control. He makes our choices for us, and in doing so, we are free from the burden of decision-making.</p>
                            <p> This true freedom comes from being one with God. When we submit to Him, we allow Him to replace our consciousness with His. As Psalm 23 says, "The Lord is my Shepherd; I have all that I need. He makes me lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside still waters; he refreshes my soul" (Psalm 23:1-2). With God as our Shepherd, we are free from worry and fear because He guides us along the right paths.</p>
                            <p> Jesus Himself said, "I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved" (John 10:9). He is the doorway to true freedom—freedom from sin, from judgment, and from death. Through Him, we can find peace, joy, and the ultimate freedom that comes from eternal life.</p>
                            <p>  In Matthew 18, Jesus also teaches about the authority given to His followers:
"Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven." (Matthew 18:18). This reminds us that when we are united with God, we have His divine authority to make the right choices, and we are freed from the consequences of sin.</p>
                            <p>  True freedom isn’t the absence of choice but the ability to make the right choices through God’s guidance. It’s the freedom to live in harmony with His will, where peace and joy flow from our decisions. As Galatians 2:20 declares, "I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me." In this oneness with God, we become free from the burden of our past and our mistakes.
</p>
                            <p> Jesus is not just the Savior; He is the doorway through which we experience true freedom. He opens the door to eternal life, and through Him, heaven comes to earth. He also said, "Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 18:18), demonstrating that with Jesus, we have the authority to live in true freedom, making the right choices according to His will.</p>
                             <p> In conclusion, true freedom comes through surrender to God. It is not about making choices without consequences, but about making the right choices with God’s guidance. Through Jesus, we are free from the bondage of sin and its consequences. We are no longer slaves to fear or error, but free to live a life in Christ, where He becomes our consciousness and guide, and through His grace, we find true peace and joy.</p>
