                            <p>It is surprising and saddening that so-called Christians all over the world, especially in the southern part of India, follow and believe in caste systems. In other parts of the world, we call it racism, which means someone is superior or inferior based on their birth, and this is completely against what God said in the Bible. How dumb can it get?

                                Throughout the Bible, from the Old to the New Testament, it is clearly mentioned that everyone is equal. To sum it up, Jesus, the center of Christianity, came to this world and gave the royal law to follow, which is "love our neighbors as we love ourselves." In other words, treat everyone the way we want to be treated, which means everyone is equal.</p>
                                
                               <p> Despite the clarity of these messages throughout the Bible given by God, so-called Christians have completely forgotten God and his words, and have worshiped their traditions and religion, following this cruel system of inequality. It is unbelievable that they all read the same Bible, but do not see these clear messages. I have seen churches built based on certain castes, which is a shameful act. They do not have to read the whole Bible to know this. If they look at Jesus' life, they can see this message throughout his life.
                                
                                He roamed with all kinds of people, from fishermen to tax collectors. As a Rabbi (Teacher), in those days it was prohibited for Rabbis to associate with people like that, as there was a set of people among Jews like rabbis and priests who considered themselves superior to others. But Jesus broke these practices and traditions. In fact, he chose such people as his own disciples. He stayed with them, ate with them, and traveled with them.</p>
                                
                               <p> In Matthew 2:15, it is mentioned that while Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?" On hearing this, Jesus said to them, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
                                
                                Another instance is when he spoke to the Samaritan woman, which again follows a similar pattern. Jews considered Samaritans inferior, and they did not even travel through Samaria because of this reason. They were ready to take the longest route to reach their destination, but not to travel through Samaria. The best part is that the particular woman whom Jesus spoke with was considered inferior even within the Samaritans because she had more than one husband. But Jesus asked her to give him some water to drink, and she was surprised that a Jew would talk to her when her own people treated her as inferior. But Jesus did.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6"> John 4:7:<br>

"When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, "Will you give me a drink?" The Samaritan woman said to him, "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?"</blockquote><br>


<p>She is the first person mentioned in the Bible who went out and told the Gospel to people. And in so many other instances, Jesus associated with all kinds of people who Jews considered inferior to them. He healed and blessed everyone. So my point is, when we say we are followers of Christ, how is it possible to live in this system of inequality? It's clearly stated in the Bible that it's either with God or against God. There is no middle place. It's either black or white, no grey area.</p><br>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">Matt 12:30:

"Whoever is not with me is against me."</blockquote><br>

<p> is a big failure in places which follow such a system. I won't even consider these people as Christians. I would say they are a perfect example of the Antichrist. People who spend so much of their time spreading religion, building churches, and converting people to their beliefs to get more people on their side have a selfish agenda. If they spent a little bit of time out of it to convey the right message that God has given to the entire humanity, it would have saved so many people and enlightened millions. The world would have been a better place. But instead, they are busy worshiping their traditions, cultures, and in some places, they even worship the priests and pastors, completely ignoring God and His ways.

How can the blind lead another blind? I see these Christian people trying so hard to convert others to their beliefs, but what good can come out of it when their belief system itself is wrong? This is why it's rightly said in the Bible:</p><br>

<blockquote class="blockquote text-danger fs-6">
Matt 7:5:<br>

"You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."</blockquote><br>

<p>But because of some people's mistakes and wrong interpretation of the Bible, it does not make God wrong. Man-made religion, not God, did this. There are many religions, but one God.

I created this blog to share some Bible verses which are God-inspired and which show that everyone is equal. These scriptures represent true Christianity. Believe in God's word, not the church, pastors, or priests. So please do not judge Christ and His ways by the stupid acts of some people. Ignore the nonsense and see His words for yourself. Read them with an open heart. Let the truth set you free.
                                </p>

                                    Galatians 3:28<br>
There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.<br>
<br>
Genesis 1:27 <br>

So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.<br>
<br>

Colossians 3:9-11<br>
Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator. Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.<br>
<br>
Acts 17:26 <br>

And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place<br>
<br>
John 3:16<br>
“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.<br>
<br>
Philippians 2:1-30<br>
So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind. Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, ...<br>
<br>
Matthew 20:16<br>
So the last will be first, and the first last.”<br>
<br>
Romans 2:11 <br>

For God shows no partiality.<br>

<br>
Romans 15:7<br>

Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.<br>
<br>
Mark 12:31 <br>

The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”<br>
<br>
Malachi 2:10<br>
Have we not all one Father? Has not one God created us? Why then are we faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?<br>
<br>
James 2:1-4<br>
My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory. For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, “You sit here in a good place,” while you say to the poor man, “You stand over there,” or, “Sit down at my feet,” have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?<br>
<br>
Romans 3:23<br>
For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,<br>
<br>
Acts 10:34-35 <br>

So Peter opened his mouth and said: “Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.<br>
<br>
Leviticus 19:33-34<br>
33 “ ‘When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. 34 The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the LORD your God.<br>
<br>
Ephesians 6:9 <br>

Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.<br>
<br>

2 Peter 3:9 ESV / 8<br>
The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.<br>
<br>
1 Timothy 2:1-15<br>
First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, ...<br>
<br>
Colossians 3:25<br>
For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.<br>
<br>
Romans 12:3<br>
For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.<br>
<br>
John 13:34<br>
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.<br>
<br>
James 2:8-9<br>
If you really fulfil the royal law according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself,” you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.<br>
<br>
Luke 10:27<br>
And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.”<br>

“You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbour.<br>
<br>
Genesis 11:1-32<br>
Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.<br>
<br>
Acts 10:28<br>
And he said to them, “You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person inferior 

or unclean.</blockquote>
